To use ncurses, change the #include in fly.c to ncurses.h instead of 
curses.h, and change the LIBS from -lcurses to -lncurses in the Makefile.

As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles, and edit the location
of the score file in pathnames.h.  Also set the MANDIR in
the Makefile.
