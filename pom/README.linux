As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

I added the following line, which probably was supposed to be in 
/usr/include/bsd/tzfile.h, but wasn't.

#define isleap(y) (((y) % 4) == 0 && ((y) % 100) != 0 || ((y) % 400) == 0)
