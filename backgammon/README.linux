Here are actually two backgammon games. One is a simple version
for dumb terminals and the other is 'fancier' and uses termcaps.

The simple one is not made by default. To make it, go to common_source
and make simple. It leaves the game in 'sbackgammon'.

The makefiles are not too smart. If you change a file in common_source,
you should probably remove its .o file if you are going to do a make
from the backgammon or teachgammon directories.
