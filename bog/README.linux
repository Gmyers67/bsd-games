I grabbed this game from comp.sources.games/volume4.  The original Makefile 
is in Makefile.orig.  

As usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles.  Also set the LIBDIR and MANDIR in
the Makefile.  If you wish to use a different dictionary, you can set DICT
in the Makefile as well.

To use ncurses, replace -lcurses with -lncurses in the Makefile.  Also replace
the #include <curses.h> line with #include <ncurses.h> in help.c, mach.c,
prtable.c and timer.c.
