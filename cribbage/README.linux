As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

As usual, set the SCOREFILE and PAGERFILE in the Makefile; remember to
update cribbage.6.

If you change any of the predefined paths, remember to make corresponding
changes in the man page.
