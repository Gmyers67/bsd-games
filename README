Here is the bsd-games package, containing ports of your favorite
(mostly curses-based) BSD games (descriptions to follow).  These games
came from NetBSD-current, except for hunt.  The original sources for
hunt are at <URL:ftp://ftp.cgl.ucsf.edu/pub/hunt.shar.Z>.  There's not
much to do in porting most of them, mostly busy-work.  We didn't
really try to enhance them.  Maybe later.  We wanted to get out what
we thought were the most popular games first so we will eventually
hopefully have the whole bunch done.  (If you want to help, contact
me!).

The games should work with ncurses (3.0, 3.4, 4.0 or 4.1 at least).
They may also work with curses/termcap, but this is not tested by me.
They should work with both libc5 and libc6 (glibc 2).  Note however
that I don't test all possible combinations of libraries for each
release, so tell me if some versions don't work.

For the current release, libc6 support is BETA level only and the
games may not even compile, but they should be much closer to
compiling with libc6 than in version 1.4.

You need to configure the package with `./configure'.  You should read
any README.linux files for the games you plan to install. You can make
each game individually or do a make in the top level directory to make
everything.  The `Makefile.bsd' files are the original BSD makefiles.

Two games that were in this package up to version 1.3, boggle and
paranoia, are now distributed separately because of restrictive
copyrights.  If you want them, get the bsd-games-non-free package,
which will unpack into a `bsd-games-n.n' directory like this one does,
and read the README.non-free that it contains.  (These games aren't
actually from BSD.  Rogue is also in bsd-games-non-free.)  This
probably won't be available from tsx-11, but may be on sunsite.  You
can also build bsd-games-non-free separately; it contains some of the
same files, which are all exact duplicates.  If the only
subdirectories you have are boggle, hangman, paranoia and rogue, then you
have just bsd-games-non-free.

Here's what we have so far:
