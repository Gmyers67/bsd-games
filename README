README for bsd-games
====================

This is the bsd-games package for Linux, containing ports of all the
open source games from NetBSD-current. This particular version is a
copy of version 2.17 released in 2005, forked with intent to clean up
the code and build system to modern standards. Also, subprojects that
are maintained elsewhere or are not games, have been removed.

For installation instructions and details of prerequisites, see the
file "INSTALL".

This package contains the following games:

adventure:	the original adventure by Crowther and Woods
atc:		air traffic control
backgammon:	backgammon
battlestar:	adventure game on a battlestar
caesar:		performs rotated-alphabet cryptography (like rot13)
canfield:	curses-based solitaire
cribbage:	cribbage
dab:		dots and boxes
drop4:		tetromino packing game
fish:		go fish
gomoku:		gomoku
hack:		exploring the Dungeons of Doom
hangman:	guess the word before it is too late
mille:		mille borne against the computer
phantasia:	interterminal fantasy game
robots:		well... avoid the robots
sail:		sail your ship into battle
snake:		grab the cash and avoid the snake and exit
worm:		eat the numbers without running into anything
wump:		hunt the wumpus

Some games that were in the original 2.17 distribution were removed.
Some were maintained elsewhere:

banner:		https://packages.debian.org/stable/bsdmainutils
factor:		http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html
fortune:	ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/games/amusements/fortune
primes:		http://primesieve.org/
rogue:		http://coredumpcentral.org/

Some were infringing on copyrights:

boggle:		Exactly like the eponymous game by Parker Brothers.
monop:		Uses Hasbro's Monopoly board and other content.
tetris:		Renamed to drop4 after removing infringing elements.
trek:		Uses Star Trek universe and characters.

hunt was completely broken, and its premise of playing with other users
logged on to the same machine is as obsolete as mainframes and dumb
terminals. dm was a game access limiter; a dumb idea. arithmetic, quiz,
and wtf were flashcard study aids. rain and worms were screensavers,
and should be implemented as part of a lockscreen program. bcd, morse,
number, pig, pom, ppt, random, and wargames were utterly pointless.
