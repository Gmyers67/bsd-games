README for bsd-games
====================

This is the bsd-games package for Linux, containing ports of all the
open source games from NetBSD-current. This particular version is a
copy of version 2.17 released in 2005, forked with intent to clean up
the code and build system to modern standards. Also, subprojects that
are maintained elsewhere or are not games, have been removed.

Installation
------------

To install, you need ncurses, a c11-capable compiler, and a wordlist
(needed for hangman, usually in /usr/share/dict). Then:

./configure --prefix=/usr && make install

boggle:		Exactly like the eponymous game by Hasbro.
mille:		Mille Bornes is copyrighted by Hasbro.
monop:		Used Hasbro's Monopoly board and other content.
trek:		Used Star Trek universe and characters.

hunt was completely broken, and its premise of playing with other users
logged on to the same machine is as obsolete as mainframes and dumb
terminals. dm was a game access limiter; a dumb idea. arithmetic, quiz,
and wtf were flashcard study aids. rain and worms were screensavers,
and should be implemented as part of a lockscreen program. bcd, morse,
number, pig, pom, ppt, random, and wargames were utterly pointless.
