Here is the bsd-games package, containing ports of your favorite
(mostly curses-based) BSD games (descriptions to follow).  These games
mostly came from ftp.uu.net:/systems/unix/bsd-sources/games with some
older versions from the Tahoe release.  There's not much to do in
porting most of them, mostly busy-work.  We didn't really try to
enhance them.  Maybe later.  We wanted to get out what we thought were
the most popular games first so we will eventually hopefully have the
whole bunch done.  (If you want to help, contact me!).

The games should work with ncurses (3.0, 3.4 or 4.0 at least).  They
may also work with curses/termcap, but this is not tested by me.
Support for libc 6 will be added in a later release.

You need to configure the package with `./configure'.  You should read
any README.linux files for the games you plan to install.  (Some of
these README.linux files are out of date). You can make each package
individually or do a make in the top level directory to make
everything.  The `Makefile.orig' files are the original BSD makefiles.

Two games that were in this package up to version 1.3, bog and
paranoia, are now distributed separately because of restrictive
copyrights.  If you want them, get the bsd-games-non-free package,
which will unpack into a `bsd-games-n.n' directory like this one does,
and read the README.non-free that it contains.  (These games aren't
actually from BSD.)  This probably won't be available from tsx-11, but
may be on sunsite.

Here's what we have so far:

		bow ...
wargames:	would you like to play a game?
