README for bsd-games
====================

This is the bsd-games package for Linux, containing ports of all the
open source games from NetBSD-current. This particular version is a
copy of version 2.17 released in 2005, forked with intent to clean up
the code and build system to modern standards. Also, subprojects that
are maintained elsewhere or are not games, have been removed.

Installation
