Version 1.3.1beta
=================

* Now works with libc 5 ;-).

* Debian patches from Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org> mostly
integrated up to Debian version 1.3-7.

* New ports of tetris and gomoku, thanks to David Frey
<david@eos.lugs.ch>.

* Distributed as source only.

* Many bug-fixes to battlestar.

* Configuration script, now substitutes correct paths in manpages.

* Defaults hopefully closer to FSSTND/FHS.

* Builds with ncurses by default.  Curses/termcap are obsolete and no
longer supported (not that this package is supported anyway ;-)).
