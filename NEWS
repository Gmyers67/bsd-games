This file contains a summary of changes in each version after 1.3.
For fuller details, see ChangeLog and ChangeLog.0.

Version 1.3.3beta
=================

* Non-free package now contains all the files required to build on its
own.  It can now be built on its own, or in the same source tree as
bsd-games; the files that appear in both are exact duplicates.

* Bug-fixes in backgammon and sail.

Version 1.3.2beta
=================

* Non-free games (bog and paranoia) now distributed separately -
unpack both source packages together before configuring if you want to
build them.

* Configuration script improved: now the default list of games to
build is the list of subdirectories, and you can configure the exact
paths to score files and data files for individual games using it - so
they are always correctly substituted in the manpages.

* Bug-fixes in backgammon, snake and worm.

* Arithmetic and atc updated to the versions in NetBSD-current.

Version 1.3.1beta
=================

* Now works with libc 5 ;-).

* Debian patches from Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org> mostly
integrated up to Debian version 1.3-7.

* New ports of tetris and gomoku, thanks to David Frey
<david@eos.lugs.ch>.

* Distributed as source only.

* Many bug-fixes to battlestar.

* Configuration script, now substitutes correct paths in manpages.

* Defaults hopefully closer to FSSTND/FHS.

* Builds with ncurses by default.  Curses/termcap are obsolete and no
longer supported (not that this package is supported anyway ;-)).
