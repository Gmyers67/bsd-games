1998-03-26 - Known bugs
=======================

I know of the following bugs in bsd-games; there is no need to report
them if you come across them, but fixes are welcome.

General
=======

Some games may not handle signals (especially resizing) properly.

Some games may not check for errors when they should, or may return
inappropriate exit statuses.

Some games may have arbitrary limits that they should not have.

Specific games
==============

Under some circumstances, hunt fails to start the hunt daemon if one
is not already running.

Saving in monop is completely broken.  Since it assumes it can save by
writing out the whole data space from 0 to sbrk(0) and read it in to
restore, it may not be easy to fix.
