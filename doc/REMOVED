Many programs that were in the original 2.17 distribution were removed to
make the package more focused on actual gaming rather than preservation
of useless junk of interest only to ancient computer history fanatics.
Perhaps someone would like to maintain a separate bsd-junk package?
Anyway, programs were removed for the following specific reasons:

Some are already maintained as standalone packages:

backgammon:	http://gnubg.org/
banner:		https://packages.debian.org/stable/bsdmainutils
factor:		http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html
fortune:	ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/games/amusements/fortune
primes:		http://primesieve.org/
rogue:		http://coredumpcentral.org/

Some were infringing on copyrights:

boggle:		Exactly like the eponymous game by Hasbro.
mille:		Mille Bornes is copyrighted by Hasbro.
monop:		Used Hasbro's Monopoly board and other content.
trek:		Used Star Trek universe and characters.

Several were multiplayer games for people logged on to the same server,
a situation that no longer exists anywhere.

hunt:		multiplayer only, and has been broken for some time.
dm:		a way to stop other users from playing games.
phantasia:	mostly multiplayer; playing alone consisted of pressing
		"1" until you are randomly killed by one of a never
		ending succession of monsters. There were no rewards,
		score, fun hit descriptions, or anything else.

Finally, a bunch of programs were of no use whatsoever.

arithmetic:	study aid. We have calculators now.
quiz:		quizzes on obscure and/or obsolete information.
wtf:		outdated acronym lookup. We have Google now.
rain, worms:	screensavers. We have lockscreen programs now.
bcd, ppt:	even museums can't read punchcards any more.
morse:		morse code translator? what for?
number:		prints badly formated text numbers. why?
pig:		I have no idea what this is for.
pom:		phase of the moon?
random:		see fortune above.
wargames:	a short shell script that prints a one-line message.
