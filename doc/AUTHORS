Authors of bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
===========================================

The bsd-games package was originally created by Curt Olson
<curt@me.umn.edu> and Andy Tefft <teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com>. The games
themselves were written by many contributers to *BSD over the past
twenty years or so. Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org> wrote the manpages for
wargames and paranoia. Based on the source and manpages, here are the
details of the people who originally wrote the games over more than 20
years. Many of the email addresses below are probably no longer valid.
