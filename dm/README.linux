Dm is the `dungeon master', a program that allows you to control when
users can play games.  (Note that this does not control any private
copies of games they may have).  I do not claim that this program is
actually useful, but it is included in bsd-games since it is in
NetBSD.

Add -DLOG to the DEFS in the Makefile if you want logging of games
playing.
