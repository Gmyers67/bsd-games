For recent work (since 1.3), thanks to:

Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>

  For the Debian patches, which covered what was needed to make the games
  compile with current libraries, provided many bug fixes and showed
  where I needed to do things like parametrise manpages.

David Frey <david@eos.lugs.ch>

  For the ports of tetris and gomoku.

For the original bsd-games package (versions up to 1.3):

Special Thanks to:

Andy Tefft (teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com)

  For porting backgammon, canfield, fortune, and number.  Andy also was a
  big help in organizing this project, and in getting the ball rolling in
  the early stages.

Thanks also to:
  Ross Becker (beckerr@pyrite.som.cwru.edu) - working on hunt.
  jyanowit@orixa.mtholyoke.edu - backgammon bug fix.
  Andrew Kuchling (fnord@binkley.cs.mcgill.ca) - bog bug fix.
  Rik Faith (faith@cs.unc.edu) - words file for hangman and bog.

We should also thank the original authors of the games over more than
20 years. The details here are taken from the source and manpages;
