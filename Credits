For recent work (since 1.3), thanks to:

Joey Hess <joeyh@master.debian.org>

  For the Debian patches, which covered what was needed to make the games
  compile with current libraries, provided many bug fixes and showed
  where I needed to do things like parametrise manpages.

David Frey <david@eos.lugs.ch>

  For the ports of tetris and gomoku.

For the original bsd-games (versions up to 1.3):

Special Thanks to:

Andy Tefft (teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com)

  For porting backgammon, canfield, fortune, and number.  Andy also was a
  big help in organizing this project, and in getting the ball rolling in
  the early stages.
