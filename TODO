TODO list for bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
==============================================

Please let me (jsm28@cam.ac.uk) know if you're interested in doing any
of these, or have done work on them, so we can avoid duplication of
effort.  The order of entries is just the order they were added in, not any
priority order.

The file BUGS lists known bugs; you may wish to work on some of
those.  The issues listed there are not included in this list.

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  Most of
             this has been done, through adopting changes from
             OpenBSD, but a thorough audit is needed - see SECURITY.
             There are rumours of the games having been audited by the
             Linux Security Audit Project (see linux-kernel archives
             and Alan Cox's diary at
             <URL:http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/alan.shtml>)
             but I have received no patches.

1997-04-29 - Fix compilation warnings with increasingly strict warning
             options.  -Wwrite-strings (and general use of const) is
             currently being worked on.

1997-04-29 - Get changes (at least the bug-fixes) merged back into NetBSD.
             Various patches for specific bugs have been sent in and
             applied: more still needs to be done, and some patches
             are currently waiting in their bug tracking system.

1997-05-01 - Games with scorefiles should lock them when updating them.

1997-07-15 - Get distribution permission for hack and larn.  Get
             licence of rogue clarified.  (See NetBSD PR 5850.)

1998-07-28 - Support building in a directory other than the source directory.

1998-08-18 - Fix whatever makes rogue need -fwritable-strings.  This
             seem to be various arrays of struct id being initialised
             with constant strings, but then being modified in the
             course of saving and restoring.  Only object.c needs to
             be compiled with -fwritable-strings.

1998-08-27 - Convert the games that use termcap to use curses.
             Currently these are backgammon, rain, snake, tetris and
             worms.  Somewhat hacked versions of rain and worms that
             use curses are distributed as test programs with ncurses;
             these might just possibly be useful.

1998-08-27 - If we build a game that links to another game's manpage,
             but don't install the other game, then we get a dangling
             symlink or .so for the manpage.

1998-08-27 - Merge in improvements from OpenBSD.

1998-08-27 - Fix warnings with -Wl,--warn-common (i.e., variables should be
             declared extern in the header, and defined non-extern
             exactly once).

1998-09-04 - dm should not access the utmp file directly.

1998-09-11 - Move building of the manpages and headers in which
             configuration variables are substituted from the
             configure script into the Makefiles.
