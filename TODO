Let me (jsm28@cam.ac.uk) know if you're interested in doing any of these.
The order is just the order they were added in, not any priority order.

The file BUGS lists known bugs; you may wish to work on some of those.

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  At present,
             they do not even drop setgid privileges except for writing
             scorefiles (sail has checks for being setuid).  The games
             should only run with setgid privileges when opening scorefiles
             for writing, and need a thorough audit for anything that
             might cause a security hole.  (OpenBSD has some security fixes,
             but the last time I checked their source tree was very
             distant from that for NetBSD because they had not
             incorporated the NetBSD compiler warning fixes, making
             security fixes difficult to incorporate.  If NetBSD add
             security fixes they will get included.)

1997-04-29 - Fix compilation warnings with increasingly strict warning options.

1997-04-29 - Get changes (at least the bug-fixes) merged back into NetBSD.
             Or should it be FreeBSD or OpenBSD?  (This is waiting on a
             response from NetBSD to PR 4032.)

1997-05-01 - Games with scorefiles should lock them when updating them.

1997-07-15 - Get distribution permission for hack and larn.

1997-12-15 - Backgammon should return sensible exit statuses on error.

1997-12-19 - Hunt needs to be thoroughly tested.
