TODO list for bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free
==============================================

Please let me (jsm28@cam.ac.uk) know if you're interested in doing any
of these, or have done work on them, so we can avoid duplication of
effort.  The order of entries is just the order they were added in, not any
priority order.

The file BUGS lists known bugs; you may wish to work on some of those.

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  Most of
             this has been done, through adopting changes from
             OpenBSD, but a thorough audit is needed - see SECURITY.
             There are rumours of the games having been audited by the
             Linux Security Audit Project (see linux-kernel archives
             and Alan Cox's diary at
             <URL:http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/alan.shtml>)
             but I have received no patches.

1997-04-29 - Fix compilation warnings with increasingly strict warning options.

1997-04-29 - Get changes (at least the bug-fixes) merged back into NetBSD.
             Various patches for specific bugs have been sent in and
             applied: more still needs to be done, and some patches
             are currently waiting in their bug tracking system.

1997-05-01 - Games with scorefiles should lock them when updating them.

1997-07-15 - Get distribution permission for hack and larn.  Get
             licences of boggle and rogue clarified.  (See NetBSD PR
             5850.)

1997-12-15 - Backgammon should return sensible exit statuses on error.

1997-12-19 - Hunt needs to be thoroughly tested.

1998-07-28 - Use GNU Make's automatic dependency generation.

1998-07-28 - Support building in a directory other than the source directory.

1998-08-06 - Maybe use a single project Makefile rather than recursive
             make; see
             http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html
             for reasons to do this.

1998-08-18 - Fix whatever makes rogue need -fwritable-strings.
