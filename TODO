Let me know if you're interested in doing any of these.  The order is just
the order they were added in, not any priority order.

1993-09-25 - Hunt needs to worked through to make sure it will run over a
             network.

1997-04-29 - Move configuration of score file names, etc., to configure
             script and remove most individual games' README.linux files
             (which won't then be needed).

1997-04-29 - Test glibc and alpha compilation.  (Do this after current
             NetBSD sources are integrated.)

1997-04-29 - Test architectures other that i386 and alpha (I can't do this
             myself).

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  At present,
             they do not even drop setgid privileges except for writing
             scorefiles (sail has checks for being setuid).  The games
             should only run with setgid privileges when opening scorefiles
             for writing, and need thorough checking for anything that
             might cause a security hole.  (This probably needs an expert.
             Without it, I do not recommend making the games setgid games
             unless you are prepared for your users _easily_ to be able to
             get a shell with gid games privileges.)

1997-04-29 - Fix all compilation warnings.  Then fix all warnings with
             gcc -Wall.

1997-04-29 - Paranoia and wargames have no manpages.  Minimal ones should
             be written.

1997-04-29 - What are sail/{:file,:scene,:ship,:specs} and do we need them?

1997-04-29 - Merge in changes to games in NetBSD-current.

1997-04-29 - Add all the remaining games from NetBSD.

1997-04-29 - Get changes (at least the bug-fixes) merged back into NetBSD.
             Or should it be FreeBSD or OpenBSD?

1997-04-30 - Separate bog and paranoia into separate package.
