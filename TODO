Let me (jsm28@cam.ac.uk) know if you're interested in doing any of these.
The order is just the order they were added in, not any priority order.

1997-04-29 - Test architectures other than i386 (I can't do this myself).
             The Debian version builds on m68k, powerpc, sparc, or at least
             has done so in the past.  I have also done an alpha build, and
             glibc has worked in the past.

1997-04-29 - Improve security of games when running setgid.  At present,
             they do not even drop setgid privileges except for writing
             scorefiles (sail has checks for being setuid).  The games
             should only run with setgid privileges when opening scorefiles
             for writing, and need thorough checking for anything that
             might cause a security hole.  (This probably needs an expert.
             Without it, I do not recommend making the games setgid games
             unless you are prepared for your users _easily_ to be able to
             get a shell with gid games privileges.)

1997-04-29 - Fix compilation warnings with increasingly strict warning options.

1997-04-29 - Paranoia and wargames have no manpages.  Minimal ones should
             be written.

1997-04-29 - Get changes (at least the bug-fixes) merged back into NetBSD.
             Or should it be FreeBSD or OpenBSD?

1997-05-01 - Games with scorefiles should lock them when updating them.

1997-07-15 - Get distribution permission for hack and larn.

1997-12-15 - Backgammon should return sensible exit statuses on error.

1997-12-19 - Hunt needs to be thoroughly tested.
