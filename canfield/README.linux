As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch. The original
is in Makefile.orig. Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd. Perhaps later I will enhance the Makefiles but it doesn't
seem worth the effort.

You can change the name of the score file in the Makefile.  If you do
this, remember to update canfield/canfield.6.
