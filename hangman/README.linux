As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

As usual, set the WORDSFILE in the Makefile if you want a name other than
hangman-words, or to use an already installed word list.

If you change any of the predefined paths, remember to make corresponding
changes in the man page.
