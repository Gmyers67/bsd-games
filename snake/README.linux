As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The originals
are in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual SCOREFILE and RAWSCOREFILE in the Makefile.

If you change any of the predefined paths, remember to make corresponding
changes in the man page.
