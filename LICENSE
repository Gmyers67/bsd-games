I believe that the following copyrights and licence terms apply to the
games distributed in bsd-games and bsd-games-non-free.  (The copyright
years given below are those that appear on any of the files so
licensed.)

Most games are under the standard BSD terms:

The game "hunt" has a similar licence, mentioning the University of
California, San Francisco:

These terms also apply to "hunt/Makeconfig", which is derived from the
hunt "Makefile.inc" distributed by NetBSD.

The files "backgammon/backgammon/backlocal.h" "hack/extern.h",
"robots/auto.c", "sail/display.h", "sail/restart.h" and the game "dab"

   Copy permission is hereby granted provided that this notice is
   retained on all partial or complete copies.

   For more info on this and all of my stuff, mail edjames@berkeley.edu.

The game "boggle" used to bear a copyright notice in the name of Barry
Brachman, but he confirmed that he had assigned his copyright to the
University of California and the continued inclusion of the old
copyright notice was an omission on their part.

The game "phantasia" is not copyrighted, but has the following notice:

"hack/pathnames.h" bears a BSD copyright notice and licence;
"hack/hack.tty.c" bears one in addition to that in those listed above;
"hack/extern.h" bears the notice in the name of The NetBSD Foundation
listed above.

The files "bsd-games.lsm", "ChangeLog.0", "THANKS", "INSTALL" and
"README" are still significantly derived from files in the original
bsd-games package for Linux by Curt Olson and Andy Tefft.  It is
expected that the following terms will apply to these files, and to
the compilation copyright on the package as a whole; ***this has yet
to be confirmed with Andy Tefft***:

   Copyright (c) 1993 Curt Olson, Andy Tefft.
   Copyright (c) 1997-2005 Joseph Samuel Myers.
