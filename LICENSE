"hack/pathnames.h" bears a BSD copyright notice and licence;
"hack/hack.tty.c" bears one in addition to that in those listed above;
"hack/extern.h" bears the notice in the name of The NetBSD Foundation
listed above.

The files "bsd-games.lsm", "ChangeLog.0", "THANKS", "INSTALL" and
"README" are still significantly derived from files in the original
bsd-games package for Linux by Curt Olson and Andy Tefft.  It is
expected that the following terms will apply to these files, and to
the compilation copyright on the package as a whole; ***this has yet
to be confirmed with Andy Tefft***:

   Copyright (c) 1997-2005 Joseph Samuel Myers.
