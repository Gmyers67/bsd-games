8/21/93 - Installation directions
---------------------------------

Source Release

  1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution.  i.e. the
      directory that contains this file.  (Your probably already here!)
  2.  type make
  3.  become root
  4.  type make install

  If something doesn't install correctly you probably have a non-standard
  Linux configuration. :) :) :)  Actually, let us know, we probably
  screwed something up.  (curt@sledge.mn.org or teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com)

  Each subdirectory has a README.linux file.  If you are still having 
  trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some 
  helpful hints.


Binary Release:

  1.  become root
  2.  cd /
  3.  zcat <bin-tar-file-name> | tar xvf -
