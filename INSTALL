1997-05-03 - Installation directions
====================================

Non-free games
==============

Two games, bog and paranoia, are distributed separately because of
copyright restrictions.  If you want them, get the bsd-games-non-free
package, and unpack it in the same directory you unpacked this in
before proceeding.  If you do, cd to bog and decide if you want -DPURE
or not -- see bog/README.linux for more information.  If you are in a
hurry, don't worry about it ... it really is more of an aesthetic
thing.  You can also build bsd-games-non-free separately.  (This file
is also in bsd-games-non-free; if you only have bog, hangman and
paranoia subdirectories, then you have just this package.)

Building and installation
=========================

1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution.  i.e. the
    directory that contains this file.  (You're probably already here!)
2.  Run ./configure and configure the installation to your liking.
3.  Type make.  Ignore compiler warnings.  They will mostly be fixed in
    a later release.
4.  Become root.
5.  Type make install.

Further information
===================

Some subdirectories have README.linux files.  If you are still having
trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some
helpful hints, or information about further configuaration options.

See TODO for information on what needs to be improved in this package;
you may want to volunteer for some of the things in there.
