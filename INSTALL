1997-05-01 - Installation directions
====================================

(Note, first cd to bog and decide if you want -DPURE or not -- see
    bog/README.linux for more information.  If you are in a hurry,
    don't worry about it ... it really is more of an aesthetic thing.)

1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution.  i.e. the
    directory that contains this file.  (You're probably already here!)
2.  Run ./configure and configure the installation to your liking.
3.  Type make.  Ignore compiler warnings.
4.  Become root.
5.  Type make install.

  Each subdirectory has a README.linux file.  If you are still having 
  trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some 
  helpful hints.
