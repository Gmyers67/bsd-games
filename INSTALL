1997-07-15 - Installation directions
====================================

Non-free games
==============

Three games, boggle, paranoia and rogue, are distributed separately
because of copyright restrictions.  If you want them, get the
bsd-games-non-free package, and unpack it in the same directory you
unpacked this in before proceeding.  If you do, cd to boggle and decide
if you want -DPURE or not -- see boggle/README.linux for more
information.  If you are in a hurry, don't worry about it ... it
really is more of an aesthetic thing.  You can also build
bsd-games-non-free separately.  (This file is also in
bsd-games-non-free; if you only have boggle, hangman, paranoia and rogue
subdirectories, then you have just this package.)

Building and installation
=========================

1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution.  i.e. the
    directory that contains this file.  (You're probably already here!)
2.  Run ./configure and configure the installation to your liking.
    There may be some games you don't want to build because you have them
    from another package; for example, there is another fortune package
    (fortune-mod) available, and factor is included in GNU sh-utils as of
    version 1.12q.  Also banner is in util-linux.  At present, there's no
    simple way to say you don't want a particular game - you have to list
    those you do want.  You can work around this by removing the
    directories for the games you don't want, or renaming them to begin
    with a dot.
3.  Type make.  Ignore compiler warnings.  They will mostly be fixed in
    a later release.
4.  Become root.
5.  Type make install.
6.  If you had an old installation of bsd-games, check for file locations
    that have changed.  You will probably want to remove old executables
    and static data (formerly defaulting to installation in /usr/games/lib),
    and replace any empty score files that have been installed with your old
    ones (checking the permissions).
7.  You may wish to do something with the BSD Users' Supplementary Documents
    for trek and rogue, in trek/USD.doc/trek.me and rogue/USD.doc/rogue.me.

Further information
===================

Some subdirectories have README.linux files.  If you are still having
trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some
helpful hints, or information about further configuaration options.

See TODO for information on what needs to be improved in this package;
you may want to volunteer for some of the things in there.
