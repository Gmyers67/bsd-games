Non-free games
==============

Three games, boggle, paranoia and rogue, are distributed separately
because of copyright restrictions.  If you want them, get the
bsd-games-non-free package, and unpack it in the same directory you
unpacked this in before proceeding.  If you do, cd to boggle and
decide if you want -DPURE or not -- see boggle/README.linux for more
information.  If you are in a hurry, don't worry about it ... it
really is more of an aesthetic thing.  You can also build
bsd-games-non-free separately.  (This file is also in
bsd-games-non-free; if you only have boggle, hangman, include,
paranoia and rogue subdirectories, then you have just this package.)

Prerequisites
=============

You need gcc, libc5 (versions 5.4.x) or libc6, and ncurses (version
3.0 or later).  Older versions of libc5 (or even libc4) may work, as
may older versions of ncurses, or BSD curses/termcap, but these are
completely unsupported; even with ncurses 3.0 or later you may run
into problems with some games dependent on the version of ncurses; if
so, get a debugging version of ncurses (libncurses_g.a), link with
-lncurses_g instead of -lncurses, and good luck bug-hunting.  If the
display gets confused in ordinary use (as opposed for example to after
resizing the window), this might be a bug in the game, but is probably
a bug in ncurses.  You also need some sort of lex and yacc; by default
this package will use flex and bison, but byacc will probably work as
well.

The makefiles assume `make' is GNU make, which it almost certainly
will be on any Linux system.  Any other make that understands
`include' directives to include other makefiles would probably work as
well.  The configure script uses `#!/bin/bash', but you can run it
with `bash configure' if you keep bash in another place, and it should
indeed work with any POSIX.2 shell.

Building and installation
=========================

1.  cd to the top level directory in the source distribution, i.e. the
    directory that contains this file.  There is not yet any support for
    building in a directory other than the source directory.
2.  Run `./configure' and configure the installation to your liking.
    There may be some games you don't want to build because you have them
    from elsewhere; for example, there is another fortune package
    (fortune-mod) available, and factor is included in GNU sh-utils as of
    version 1.12q.  Also banner is in util-linux.  At present, there's no
    simple way to say you don't want a particular game - you have to list
    those you do want.  You can work around this by removing the
    directories for the games you don't want before running configure, or
    renaming them to begin with a dot.
3.  Type `make'.  You can probably ignore compiler warnings, although most
    should be fixed in this release.
4.  Become root.
5.  Type `make install'.
6.  If you had an old installation of bsd-games, check for file locations
    that have changed.  You will probably want to remove old executables
    and static data (formerly defaulting to installation in /usr/games/lib),
    and replace any empty score files that have been installed with your old
    ones (checking the permissions).
7.  You may wish to do something with the BSD Users' Supplementary Documents
    for trek and rogue, in trek/USD.doc/trek.me and rogue/USD.doc/rogue.me.
    You can look at them on a text terminal with `nroff -me' (piped to your
    pager), or format in PostScript for printing with `groff -me -Tps'.

Further information
===================

Some subdirectories have README.linux files.  If you are still having
trouble with a program, check this file first -- it may contain some
helpful hints, or information about further configuaration options.

See TODO for information on what needs to be improved in this package;
you may want to volunteer for some of the things in there.
